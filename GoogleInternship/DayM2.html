							<p>Spent most of this day at the Computer History Museum</p>
							<p>Here are some of the things I saw. I haven't uploaded everything as I'm lazy</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/Hollerith.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>This machine was used for processing US Census records in 1980, the data being fed by punch cards. This system of using punched cards was created by Herman Hollerith.</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/IBMsystem360.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>With the ability to upgrade, and "emulate" older IBM products, the IBM system/360 became a major success for IBM </p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/Cray1.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>The Cray 1 machine was the world's fastest machine for 5 years, a feat unimaginable today.</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/PDP8.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>The first commercially successful minicomputer, DEC sold over 10,000 machines of its over dozen variations of the PDP-8</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/FirstMouseReplica.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>A replica of the mouse as envisioned by Douglas Engelbart</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/NEXTcomputer.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>The NeXT computer, running an OS that would eventually become OS X, allowed Tim Bernes-Lee to create the Web in just three months</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/IntelCpus.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>An assortment of Intel CPUs derived from the 8086 architecture</p>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/PDP1action.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>We were given a demonstration of the only working (they claim) PDP1 in the world. It took them 2 years to restore. What was their end goal? To play SpaceWars<p/>
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../assets/loader.gif" data-src="DayM2/NESshrine.JPG" alt="" />
							<p>A display dedicated to the NES. The camera didn't pick it up well, but the Zelda cart is gold</p>
