							<p>During my time working at Halfords, I started to cycle to and from work. With a phone holder on the handlebar, I was able to use my phone to navigate a route, but as I memorised the route, I found myself wanting other features displayed on the screen, namely the time and current speed.</p>
							
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../../assets/loader.gif" data-src="SimpleSpeedo/appSS.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>I tried many speedometer applications, but none of them satisfied my need of displaying a time and speed in portrait and in large text. Moreover, many of them came bundled with other options that I wasn't interested in, and many also came with permissions that I would rather not grant. </p>
							
							<img class="image dsOnly" src="../../assets/loader.gif" data-src="SimpleSpeedo/permissions.jpg" alt="" />
							<p>I set about creating my own that satisfied my needs: no unnecessary permissions, no unnecessary features and large text that can display the time, speed and distance. The UI was simple, as I wanted to be have the information in just a glance while riding. </p>

							<p>In the end, I created an application that was perfect for my needs, and I was able to get a lot of good use out of it.</p>
